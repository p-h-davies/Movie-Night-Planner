# Date-Night-Planner


# Description
Have you ever said 'what should we do tonight?" Well, this application is your answer to that question!

The user is presented with a quiz, where they're invited to answer a series of questions. The answers to these questions will generate a date night for them, personalised to their tastes. 

Results include:
Exploring Cafes
Going to Bars 
Visiting Tourist Attractions
Movie Nights (sorted by genre)
Make cocktails at home
Cook dinner together

 When the user comes to the first question of the quiz, they are presented with two options, where they can select 'Go Out' or 'Stay In'. In the 'Go Out' Section, results will generate a date location outside of their home, according to their taste, budget and ability to travel. 
 
 In the 'Stay in' section, they can find three options where they can choose between Movie Night, Cocktail Night, Dinner Night. In the Movie Night section, the user is able to peruse a list of movies, changing the list according to a category selection section, and they can decide also choose to watch a trailer. In The Cocktail Night section, the user can generate lists of cocktails according to their taste and availabilty of ingredients in their home. In the Dinner Night section, the user can generate different dishes to cook by entering different ingredients which they have available. Last but not the least, the user is able to save their selection in the to-do-list. Upon their next visit, they can find their previous results there.
